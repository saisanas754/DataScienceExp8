## ‚öñÔ∏è Responsible AI Considerations

### 1. Fairness and Bias
- **Potential Risks:**
  - Bias may exist in `region`, `gender`, or `age_range` distributions, leading to unequal representation.
  - `platform`-based data may skew toward specific demographics.
- **Mitigation:**
  - Perform distribution checks and reweight samples for underrepresented categories.
  - Use fairness-aware models (e.g., reweighing, equalized odds) when training ML models.

### 2. Privacy
- **Personal Information:** None.  
- All data points represent aggregated social media insights; no personally identifiable information (PII) is included.  
- **Compliance:** Follows GDPR and CCPA guidelines by excluding user-level data.

### 3. Transparency
- **Data Source:** Derived from simulated or publicly available brand-level social media engagement data.  
- **Usage Intent:** Educational and research purposes to study social engagement analytics and brand strategy.

### 4. Accountability
- Track model decisions using explainable AI tools such as SHAP or LIME.  
- Document preprocessing steps, normalization, and any manual feature creation.

### 5. Environmental Impact
- Optimize training resources by using efficient models and batch sizes.  
- Use cloud services that support carbon-neutral compute options if applicable.
